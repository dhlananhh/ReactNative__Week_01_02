// Coding Challenge #1

/*
    Your tasks:
        1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a 'speed' property. 
        The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in km/h
        2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
    and log the new speed to the console
        3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, 
    and log the new speed to the console
        4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them
    
    Test data:
        ยง Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
        ยง Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h
*/


// 1. Constructor function for Car
function Car(make, speed) {
    this.make = make; // The make of the car
    this.speed = speed; // The current speed of the car in km/h
}

// 2. Method to accelerate the car
Car.prototype.accelerate = function() {
    this.speed += 10; // Increase speed by 10
    console.log(`${this.make} is going at ${this.speed} km/h`); // Log new speed
};

// 3. Method to brake the car
Car.prototype.brake = function() {
    this.speed -= 5; // Decrease speed by 5
    console.log(`${this.make} is going at ${this.speed} km/h`); // Log new speed
};

// 4. Create two Car objects
const car1 = new Car('BMW', 120);
const car2 = new Car('Mercedes', 95);

// Experiment with calling accelerate and brake
car1.accelerate(); // BMW is going at 130 km/h
car1.accelerate(); // BMW is going at 140 km/h
car1.brake();      // BMW is going at 135 km/h

car2.accelerate(); // Mercedes is going at 105 km/h
car2.brake();      // Mercedes is going at 100 km/h
car2.brake();      // Mercedes is going at 95 km/h
